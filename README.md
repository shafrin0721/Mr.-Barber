🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3 for semantic markup and styling

JavaScript/TypeScript for dynamic interaction

Responsive design using Flexbox/Grid or a CSS framework as appropriate

Version-control with Git & GitHub

(Optionally) APIs for server-side logic or data storage

🎯 Usage
Visit the landing page and register as a customer or stylist.

Customers can view available time-slots and book appointments.

Stylists can update their schedules and mark slots as available or unavailable.

Shop managers (admin) can monitor bookings, manage stylists, and adjust availability.

✅ To-Do / Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time notifications (email / SMS) for booking confirmations, cancellations, or rescheduling.

Add payment processing (e.g., via Stripe or PayPal) for paid appointments.

Implement persistent backend storage (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) and RESTful APIs.

Add user roles & permissions (customer, stylist, admin) with secure login.

Create analytics dashboard (e.g., number of appointments per week, popular stylists).

Improve accessibility (WCAG compliance), dark mode toggle, and internationalization (i18n).
